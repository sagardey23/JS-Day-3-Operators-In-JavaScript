<strong>Operators in JavaScript</strong>

What is an Operator?
In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables). For example,

2 + 3; // 5

Here + is an operator that performs addition, and 2 and 3 are operands.


<strong>
JavaScript Operator Types:-


1.Arithmetic Operators

2.Comparison Operators

3.Logical Operators

4.Assignment Operators

5.Ternary Operators

6.Bitwise Operators
</strong>

<strong>
1.Arithmetic operators</strong>

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic calculations. For example,

const number = 3 + 5; // 8

Here, the + operator is used to add two operands.

    <strong>
2.Comparison Operators
</strong>

Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,

const a = 3, b = 2;
console.log(a > b); // true 

Here, the comparison operator > is used to compare whether a is greater than b.

    <strong>
3.Logical Operators
  </strong>

Logical operators perform logical operations and return a boolean value, either true or false. For example,

const x = 5, y = 3;
(x < 6) && (y < 5); // true

Here, && is the logical operator AND. Since both x < 6 and y < 5 are true, the result is true.

<strong>
4.Assignment Operators
 </strong>

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. For example,

const x = 5;
Here, the = operator is used to assign value 5 to variable x.

    <strong>
5.ternary operator
 </strong>

We use the ternary operator in C to run one code when the condition is true and another code when the condition is false. 

The syntax of ternary operator is :

testCondition ? expression1 : expression 2;
</pre>

    <strong>
6.Bitwise Operators 
</strong>

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.
